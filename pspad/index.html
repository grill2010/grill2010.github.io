                                <p>If you use PSPad for the first time you have to register your PS4 with PSPad. The following sections will enlight you about the most important information</p>

                                <p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Be sure your smartphone and your PS4 are connected to the same network. Ideally your PS4 is using a wired internet connection via a LAN 
                                cable to provide best performance.</p>

                                <p><strong>Step 2</strong> - PSPad establishes a connection to your PS4 via the Remote Play protocol. In order to activate Remote Play on your PS4 you must be logged
								in with your PSN account on your PS4. Then navigate to <i>Settings</i> - <i>Remote Play Connection Settings</i> and activate the "Enable Remote Play" checkbox. Then
								go to <i>Add device</i> where you should see the 8 digit registration number.</p>

                                <p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Open PSPad and click the "Register PS4" button. On the next screen you can now enter the 8 digit registration number. If you do not use the newest 
                                PS4 firmware you can activate the "I use PS4 firmware 5-6" checkbox. If you do not know what this means just leave it unchecked. PSPad supports PS4 firmware from 5.05 - 7.02 
                                Click the "Register PS4" button.</p>

                                <p><strong>Step 4</strong> - You will now see the official Sony account website. At this point you must sign in to your PSN account which you want to use for Remote Play. 
                                If you do not want to sign in you can also activate the "Register PS4 manually" checkbox in the previous screen. However since the PS4 firmware 7.0 Sony requires the Account-ID 
                                for the registration process which is unique number linked to your PSN-Account. If you do not know it by heart your only option is to continue with the sign in process. If you use an older
                                firmware than 7.0 you can just use your well known Online-ID (Your PSN user name) during the manual registration process</p>

                                <p><strong>Disclaimer from the developer:</strong> I know providing your account details seems to be fishy and I wished there would be another method to get the Account-ID but unfortunately 
                                there is no other way. However, PSPad just opens the official PSN Log-In website from Sony and there is no technical way that PSPad could in any way intercept, monitor or modify the data you
                                have entered there. PSPad only receives some generic profile information as response from the official Sony server and only the Account-ID and the Online-ID will be stored locally on your device.
                                If you have some additional questions feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:f.grill160@gmail.com">f.grill160@gmail.com</a>.</p>

                                <p><strong>Step 5</strong> - If the registration was successful you will be redirected to the Home screen of PSPad where you can now choose to "Connect" or "Direct Connect" to your PS4.
                                If you received an error please go to <i>Troubleshooting</i></p>

                                <p>Once you are successfully registered to your PS4 you can choose to "Connect" or to "Direct Connect" to your PS4 on the PSPad Home screen. If you are on the same network than your PS4
                                simply click "Connect". If you have problems with "Connect" choose "Direct Connect" and provide the IP-Address of your PS4.</p>
                                
                                <p>If you want to use PSPad as second gamepad in addition to your real Dualshock controller you must have at least a second PS4 guest profile
                                on your PS4. The real Dualshock controller must then be connected to the PS4 profile which is not currently used by the PSPad Remote Play session, otherwise PSPad will be
                                disconnected. As mentioned before, PSPad is establishing a connection to your PS4 via the Remote Play protocol, despite no Audio and Video stream will be processed by PSPad the PS4 is sending
								these data anyway to your device. So please keep in mind that this will have an impact on your internet traffic.</p>

                        <h4>PS4 Profiles</h4>

                        <p>PSPad can be registered with multiple PS4 consoles. A profile is linked to one specific PSN account on one specific PS4 console. If you have multiple PS4 consoles and/ or multiple PSN accounts, PSPad is able to register more than one profile. If you have already registered a profile just open navigation drawer on the top left corner of the Home screen and click "Register new PS4". You can switch to another PS4 profile by clicking "Profiles" in the navigation drawer and click on the "PS4 profile" setting entry on the next screen.</p>

                        <hr>

                        <h4>On-Screen gamepad layouts</h4>

                        <p>PSPad offers you the possibility to customize the on-screen gamepad layout. You can create a new gamepad layout by clicking "Gamepad layout" in the navigation drawer. You can switch the layouts by clicking "Profiles" in the navigation drawer and click on the "Gamepad layout" for changing the gamepad layout.</p>

                        <p>You can connect any controller which is compatibly with Android 5.0 an above via Bluetooth or USB. Because of performance problems due hardware limitations on many Android devices it is strongly recommended to use a wired USB connection for your gamepad. Otherwise high input latency and input delays can occur. If you ever encounter some unusual lags please connect your gamepad via USB if possible. Please note that this is not the fault of PSPad, the reason why this happens is because of some hardware limitations of your Android device and that there is no way that PSPad could fix this.</p>
                        <p>If the button mapping of your controller is weird you can create a button mapping profile for your controller by clicking "Button mapping" in the navigation drawer. If one of your gamepad buttons is recognized as Home button you will not be able to use this button as an App can not override this behaviour. However, you can then use the "Use 2 buttons combination" feature in the mapping process instead. If you encounter some unusual button mapping please feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:f.grill160@gmail.com">f.grill160@gmail.com</a></p>

                                <p>If you are using a controller where the button mapping is messed up or you just want to change the button mapping, you can create a button mapping profile by clicking on "Button mapping" in the navigation drawer. After providing a unique button mapping profile name you can start to map individual buttons of your gamepad. Just be sure your gamepad is properly connected via Bluetooth or via USB. Please be aware that your gamepad might behave differently whether it is connected via Bluetooth or USB, so you may have to create two individual button mapping profiles.</p>
                                <p>On some devices a button on your gamepad may be interpreted as "Home" button, if that is the case you can use the "Use 2 buttons combination" feature to trigger this button by pressing a combination of two other buttons on your gamepad. You can also use this feature if you have too few buttons on your gamepad left. Again: if one of your buttons on your gamepad will be interpreted as "Home" button you will not be able to use it as an application can not override this behaviour.</p>

                        <h4>Problems with PSN login</h4>
						
						<p>Recently, some users reported problems when performing the PSN login. They will get an error message "A connection to the server could not be established". This seems to be an error on the Sony PSN login website. This PSN login is required since PS4 firmware 7.0 to get your PSN-Account-ID which is required for registering with your PS4. There are some other possibilities to get your Account-ID.</p>

                        <p>You can go to a PC and open the following website and just follow the instructions that appear there:</p>
						
						<p><a href="https://trinket.io/embed/python3/52183a157e?outputOnly=true&runOption=run&start=result&showInstructions=true" target="_blank">https://trinket.io/embed/python3/52183a157e?outputOnly=true&runOption=run&start=result&showInstructions=true</a></p>
						
						<p>If you are still getting the same error or another error please be sure the PSN credentials you are entering on the Sony PSN login page are correct otherwise you could also try using a free VPN service and pretend you're in a country other than the one you are actually in (also using another Browser might help). Then try to follow the instructions of the website above again.</p>
						
						<p>If that doesn't work either just write me an email at <a href="mailto:f.grill160@gmail.com">f.grill160@gmail.com</a> I will find out your Account-ID which you can then use to register with your PS4 without performing a PSN login. All I need for that is your PSN user name. Please note that I may be living in a different time zone than you, so it may take some time for me to reply to your email.</p>
						
						<p>If you have successfully queried your Account-ID you can register with your PS4 manually without performing a PSN login. In the Register view of PSPlay just activate the "Advanced Settings" check "Register PS4 manually" and add the Account-ID in the textbox.</p>

                        <h4>Poor connection quality</h4>

                        <p>If possible be sure your Android device is connected to a 5GHz WiFi network instead of a 2.4GHZ. 5GHz networks are usually less prone to interference.</p>

                        <p>Be sure your PS4 is connected to the internet via LAN cable.</p>

                        <p>Some Android devices are affected by a network performance problem. In order to fix this simply place your Android device in flight mode and re-enable WiFi afterwards. Restart the PSPad App and check if it works.</p>

                        <h4>Registration fails</h4>

                        <p>Be sure your smartphone is in the same network than your PS4.</p>

                        <p>Be sure that your have enabled Remote Play on your PS4. (<i>Settings</i> - <i>Remote Play Connection Settings</i> and activate the "Enable Remote Play" checkbox)</p>

                        <p>Restart the PS4 and the PSPad App and try again.</p>

                        <h4>Connection fails</h4>

                        <p>Be sure that your smartphone and your PS4 are connected to the same network.</p>

                        <p>Be sure your PS4 is turned on or at least in rest mode. If a PS4 is turned off PSPad can't wake it up.</p>

                        <h4>PS4 does not wake from rest mode</h4>

                        <p>Please be sure that your PS4 stays connected to the internet during rest mode. Navigate to <i>Settings</i> - <i>Power Saving Settings</i> - <i>Set Features Available in Rest mode</i> and check if both the "Stay Connected to the internet" and "Enable Turning On of PS4 from Network" are activated.</p>
						
						<h4>PSPad does not work correctly on my Chome OS device</h4>
						
						<p>Chrome OS offers Android app support, however some functionalities are limited and will not work. First of all, automatically discover your PS4 will not work as the firewall on Chrome OS devices is blocking the discovery request. In order to register with your PS4 or to simply connect, you have to enter the IP-Address of your PS4 manually. PSPad was not designed especially for Chrome OS devices but only for Android and Android TV devices. I do not want to prevent installations on Chrome OS devices because on some Chrome OS devices PSPad might work quite well, but please keep in mind that there could be some potential limitations when you are using PSPad on Chrome OS.</p>
