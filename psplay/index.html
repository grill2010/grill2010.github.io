                                <p>If you use PSPlay for the first time you have to register your PS4 with PSPlay. The following sections will enlight you about the most important information</p>

                                <p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Be sure your smartphone and your PS4 are connected to the same network. Ideally your PS4 is using a wired Internet connection via a LAN 
                                cable to provide best streaming performance.</p>

                                <p><strong>Step 2</strong> - In order to activate Remote Play on your PS4 you must be logged in with your PSN account on your PS4. Then navigate to <i>Settings</i> - <i>Remote 
                                Play Connection Settings</i> and activate the "Enable Remote Play" checkbox. Then go to <i>Add device</i> where you should see the 8 digit registration number.</p>

                                <p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Open PSPlay and click the "Register PS4" button. On the next screen you can now enter the 8 digit registration number. If you do not use the newest 
                                PS4 firmware you can activate the "I use PS4 firmware < 7.0" checkbox. If you do not know what this means just leave it unchecked. PSPlay supports PS4 firmware from 5.05 - 7.0. 
                                Click the "Register PS4" button.</p>

                                <p><strong>Step 4</strong> - You will now see the official Sony account website. At this point you must sign in to your PSN account which you want to use for Remote Play. 
                                If you do not want to sign in you can also activate the "Register PS4 manually" checkbox in the previous screen. However since the PS4 firmware 7.0 Sony requires the Account-ID 
                                for the registration process which is unique number linked to your PSN-Account. If you do not know it by heart your only option is to continue with the sign in process. If you use an older
                                firmware than 7.0 you can just use your well known Online-ID (Your PSN user name) during the manual registration process</p>

                                <p><strong>Disclaimer from the developer:</strong> I know providing your account details seems to be fishy and I wished there would be another method to get the Account-ID but unfortunately 
                                there is no other way. However, PSPlay just opens the official PSN Log-In website from Sony and there is no technical way that PSPlay could in any way intercept, monitor or modify the data you
                                have entered there. PSPlay only receives some generic profile information from the official Sony server and it stores the Account-ID and the Online-ID. If you have some additional questions
                                feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:f.grill160@gmail.com">f.grill160@gmail.com</a>.</p>

                                <p><strong>Step 5</strong> - If the registration was successful you will be redirected to the Home screen of PSPlay where you can now choose to "Connect" or "Direct Connect" to your PS4.
                                If you received an error please go to <i>Troubleshooting</i></p>

                                <p>Once you are successfully registered to your PS4 you can choose to "Connect" or to "Direct Connect" to your PS4 on the PSPlay Home screen. If you are on the same network than your PS4
                                simply click "Connect". If you have problems with "Connect" or if you want to play over the Internet (requires port forwarding see section <i>Playing over the Internet</i>) choose
                                "Direct Connect" and provide the IP-Address of your PS4 or your routers public IP-Address if you want to play over the Internet.</p>
                                
                                <p>PSPlay also allows you to just connect as controller without audio and video streaming so that you can use your smartphone as Dualshock controller. Just swipe to the right on the PSPlay
                                logo on the Home screen to enable the gamepad mode. If you want to use PSPlay as second gamepad in addition to your real Dualshock controller you must have at least a second PS4 guest profile
                                on your PS4. The real Dualshock controller must then be connected to the PS4 profile which is not currently used by the PSPlay Remote Play client, otherwise the Remote Play connection will be
                                terminated. During the gamepad mode no Audio and Video stream will be processed but the PS4 is sending this data anyway so please keep in mind that this will have an impact on your Internet traffic.</p>

                        <h4>PS4 Profiles</h4>

                        <p>Unlike the official PS4 Remote Play App PSPlay can be registered with multiple PS4 profiles. A profile is linked to one specific PSN account on one specific PS4 console. If you have multiple PS4 consoles and/ or multiple PSN accounts, PSPlay is able to register more than one profile. If you have already registered a profile just open navigation draw on the top left corner of the Home screen and click "Register new PS4". You can switch to another PS4 profile by clicking "Profiles" in the navigation draw and click on the "PS4 profile" setting entry on the next screen.</p>

                        <hr>

                        <h4>On-Screen gamepad layouts</h4>

                        <p>PSPlay offers you the possibility to customize the on-screen gamepad layout for both the "Remote Play Mode" and the "Gamepad Mode". You can either create a new remote layout by clicking "Remote layout" or you can create a new gamepad layout by clicking "Gamepad layout" in the navigation draw. You can switch the layouts by clicking "Profiles" in the navigation draw and click on the "Remote gamepad layout" for changing the remote layout or the "Gamepad layout" for changing the gamepad layout.</p>

                            <p>You can connect any controller which is compatibly with Android 5.0 an above via Bluetooth or USB. Because of performance problems due hardware limitations on many Android devices it is strongly recommended to use a wired USB connection for your gamepad. Otherwise high input latency and input delays can occur. If you ever encounter some unusual lags please connect your gamepad via USB if possible. Please note that this is not the fault of PSJoy, the reason why this happens is because of some hardware limitations of your Android device and that there is no way that PSPlay could fix this.</p>
                            <p>A future version of PSPlay will support additional button mapping possibilities for gamepads where the button mapping is messes up. If you encounter some unusual button mapping please feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:f.grill160@gmail.com">f.grill160@gmail.com</a></p>

This will require to set up port forwarding on your router at home in order to connect to your PS4 from outside your local network. To manually configure port forwarding on your router the following ports to the internal IP-Address of your PS4 must be forwarded.</p>

                                    <li><strong>UDP 987</strong> </li>
                                    <li><strong>UDP & TCP 9295</strong></li>
                                    <li><strong>UDP 9296</strong></li>
                                    <li><strong>UDP 9297</strong></li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>You can find a guide on how to port forward on most routers <a href="https://portforward.com/router.htm">HERE</a> (Don't be bothered by the "Portforward Network Utilities" ad, just close it, this is not required). Furthermore please configure a static IP-Address for your PS4. Otherwise you will have to adjust port forwarding settings every time your PS4 gets another IP-Address from your router (which could occur every time the PS4 restarts). An example of how to configure a static IP for your PS4 can be found <a href="https://portforward.com/networking/static-ip-ps4">HERE</a></p>
                                <p>Some routers allow you to configure a port range (start and end point port) or even to configure an internal and external port. If that is the case just provide the same port on all these available options.</p>
                                <p>If port forwarding is configured correctly you can connect to your PS4 by using the "Direct Connect" button on the Home screen of the PSPlay app. You would need to enter the public IP-Address of your router.</p>
                                <p><strong>Please note: the connection quality and streaming latency heavily depends on the quality of your Internet connection and on many other external factors. If there are lot of interferences please try to reduce the resolution and the FPS settings.</strong></p>

                            <h4>Poor connection quality</h4>

                            <p>If possible be sure your Android device is connected to a 5GHz WiFi network instead of a 2.4GHZ. 5GHz networks are usually less prone to interference.</p>

                            <p>Be sure your PS4 is connected to the Internet via LAN cable.</p>

                            <p>Lower the resolution and the FPS settings.</p>

                            <p>Some Android devices are affected by a network performance problem. In order to fix this simply place your Android device in flight mode and re-enable WiFi afterwards. Restart the PSPlay App and check if it works.</p>

                            <h4>Registration fails</h4>

                            <p>Be sure your smartphone is in the same network than your PS4.</p>

                            <p>Be sure that your have enabled Remote Play on your PS4. (<i>Settings</i> - <i>Remote Play Connection Settings</i> and activate the "Enable Remote Play" checkbox)</p>

                            <p>Restart the PS4 and the PSPlay App and try again.</p>

                            <h4>Connection fails</h4>

                            <p>If you are not playing over the Internet be sure that your smartphone and your PS4 are connected to the same network.</p>

                            <p>If you play over the Internet please check your port forwarding settings again. Your PS4 might got another IP-Address from your router at home or your routers public IP-Address might have changed.</p>

                            <p>Be sure your PS4 is turned on or at least in rest mode. If a PS4 is turned off PSPlay can't wake it up.</p>

                            <h4>PS4 does not wake from rest mode</h4>

                            <p>Please be sure that your PS4 stays connected to the Internet during rest mode. Navigate to <i>Settings</i> - <i>Power Saving Settings</i> - <i>Set Features Available in Rest mode</i> and check if both the "Stay Connected to the Internet" and "Enable Turning On of PS4 from Network" are activated.</p>
