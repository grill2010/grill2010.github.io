I'm not sitting in front of my PC and laugh like a villian in a super hero movie because I achieved my goal to make playing over the internet as hard as possible.</strong></p>

                                <p>First of all, I work hard to support and develop my apps if you have provided a bad rating on the Play Store because playing over the internet didn't work for you or you were not able to configure port forwarding correctly, please consider to update your rating after reading this. Money back is always an option if you are not satisfied. But there are things which I can't change from a technical point of view.</p>
								
								<p>Why is port forwarding needed? Imagine everyone on the world would be able to magically access devices which are connected to the internet inside your network at home, this would be a hackers paradise. Of course this doesn't work, the only device which is visible from outside is your router. The router acts like a guard which sits between your devices at home and the internet. The devices inside your network have private IP-Addresses and these are only valid inside your home network. From outside your network at home no one can just simply connect to a device inside because the private IP-Addresses are not reachable. The only device which has (usually) a public IP and is reachable from everywhere is your router. Luckily the router at home knows all the private IP-Addresses of your devices inside your network and can even reach them of course.</p>
								
								<p>This is where port forwarding comes into play, because you want to connect from outside your network at home to your PlayStation. As I already mentioned, your router has a unique public IP which is reachable from outside, therefore you must learn your router to which device inside your network he should forward connections if he gets some requests on some specific ports.</p>
								
								<p>There is absolutley no way to make this process easier and it's not something I invented. It's just the way it works. If you now think "BUT THE OFFICIAL APP IS ABLE TO...", yes I know. The reason is the official app uses some private Sony servers which are forwarding the connection to your PlayStation. In easy words, you are establishing a connection over a Sony server which is linking your Remote Play client (your device) to your PS4 behind different networks. Of course my app is not able to use this private Sony server for various obvious reasons.</p>
